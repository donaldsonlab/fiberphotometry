# fiberphotometry

In order to use the code:
1. Obtain fiberphotometry data
2. Use BORIS to score behavior and download raw data by clicking: observations -> export events -> tabular events -> select observations -> save as csv
3. Run the BORIS_format script to convert raw BORIS data to behaviorData variable
4. Run the behavior_driver which has a user interface that will guide you through the rest of the inputs

Notes: 
*make sure you have all scripts downloaded, and located in the same working directory
*If you are only doing one or only doing two fiber, you will only need the respective script
